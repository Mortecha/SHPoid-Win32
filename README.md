# SHPoid
.SHP file editor.

Found this old gem again. Thanks Omniblade for forking it all those years ago I though it was lost to time. I'll see if I can do something with it to showcase some Win32 GDI programming for my portfolio or something as I'll be completing the original SHPoid concept in .NET to showcase some .NET works.
